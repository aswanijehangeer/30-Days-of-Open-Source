### Day 1: What is Open Source?

### Day 3: Contributing to a Project
On the third of Open Source 101, we will prepare ourselves to make open source contributions. We will study this by exploring a list of popular projects and watching a video by freeCodeCamp on how to contribute to existing projects.
