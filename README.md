### Day 1: What is Open Source?
Welcome to the challenge! On the first day, let’s start by looking at some basic concepts in open source. We will read a blog by https://opensource.com on what is open-source, and another blog on how OSS (Open source software) works.

### Day 2: Getting Started in Open Source
On day one, we covered the fundamentals of open source. On Day 2, let's delve deeper into what open-source contribution entails. We will be reading two blogs that discuss how to prepare for contributing to open-source projects.

- [How to Contribute to Open Source Projects – A Beginner's Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-beginners-guide/)

### Day 3: Contributing to a Project
On the third of Open Source 101, we will prepare ourselves to make open source contributions. We will study this by exploring a list of popular projects and watching a video by freeCodeCamp on how to contribute to existing projects.

### Day 4: Version Control and Git
Version control is an important aspect of open-source contribution as it simplifies collaboration on software projects. On Day 4, we will study version control tools such as Git and learn how to manage your repository.

### Day 5: Fork and Sync from remote
On Day 5, we will apply our version control knowledge in the context of an open-source project. We will learn how to fork the repository and contribute to it, as well as how to sync a fork with your local branch.

### Day 6: Repository Management
Once you forked the repository to your local git repository, you can start your development process. Here are some common practices to manage all the operations, including commit, branch, and so on.
