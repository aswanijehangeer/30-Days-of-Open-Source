The challenge is designed for people of all skill levels and provides participants with various resources to help them get started.

[Check out the official website](https://depths.so/events/30daysopensource)

### Day 1: What is Open Source?
Welcome to the challenge! On the first day, let’s start by looking at some basic concepts in open source. We will read a blog by https://opensource.com on what is open-source, and another blog on how OSS (Open source software) works.

- [What is Open Source?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
- [What Is Open Source Software and How Does It Work?](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-open-source-software.html)

### Day 2: Getting Started in Open Source
On day one, we covered the fundamentals of open source. On Day 2, let's delve deeper into what open-source contribution entails. We will be reading two blogs that discuss how to prepare for contributing to open-source projects.

- [Open Source 101: A Beginner's Guide to Getting Started](https://dev.to/opensauced/open-source-101-a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-37fb)
