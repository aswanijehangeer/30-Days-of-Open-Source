# 30-Days-of-Open-Source

30DaysOfOpenSource is a learning challenge by Depths.io that encourages participants to learn about open-source software by contributing to open-source projects for 30 days. The challenge is designed for people of all skill levels and provides participants with various resources to help them get started.

[Check out the official website](https://depths.so/events/30daysopensource)

### Day 1: What is Open Source?
Welcome to the challenge! On the first day, let’s start by looking at some basic concepts in open source. We will read a blog by https://opensource.com on what is open-source, and another blog on how OSS (Open source software) works.

- [What is Open Source?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
- [What Is Open Source Software and How Does It Work?](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-open-source-software.html)

### Day 2: Getting Started in Open Source
On day one, we covered the fundamentals of open source. On Day 2, let's delve deeper into what open-source contribution entails. We will be reading two blogs that discuss how to prepare for contributing to open-source projects.

- [Open Source 101: A Beginner's Guide to Getting Started](https://dev.to/opensauced/open-source-101-a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-37fb)
- [How to Contribute to Open Source Projects – A Beginner's Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-beginners-guide/)

### Day 3: Contributing to a Project
On the third of Open Source 101, we will prepare ourselves to make open source contributions. We will study this by exploring a list of popular projects and watching a video by freeCodeCamp on how to contribute to existing projects.

- [7 open-source projects you should contribute to in 2023](https://dev.to/github20k/7-open-source-projects-you-should-contribute-to-in-2023-1nph)
- [Complete Guide to Open Source - How to Contribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzeVMecydCE&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

### Day 4: Version Control and Git
Version control is an important aspect of open-source contribution as it simplifies collaboration on software projects. On Day 4, we will study version control tools such as Git and learn how to manage your repository.

- [Demystifying The Differences Between Git & GitHub](https://medium.com/edureka/git-vs-github-67c511d09d3e)
- [Understanding Git (Local Repo) and GitHub (Remote Repo)](https://medium.com/swlh/git-local-repo-and-github-remote-repo-eae1c948fbf5)



### Day 5: Fork and Sync from remote
On Day 5, we will apply our version control knowledge in the context of an open-source project. We will learn how to fork the repository and contribute to it, as well as how to sync a fork with your local branch.

- [How to fork a GitHub repository and contribute to an open source project ](https://sqldbawithabeard.com/2019/11/29/how-to-fork-a-github-repository-and-contribute-to-an-open-source-project/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook)
- [Syncing a fork - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)


### Day 6: Repository Management
Once you forked the repository to your local git repository, you can start your development process. Here are some common practices to manage all the operations, including commit, branch, and so on.

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

### Day 7: Breaking Down Giant Repository
In a large project, beginners would often feel overwhelmed when looking at tons of configuration dotfile, endless nested folder structures, and so on. But you don’t need to understand every bit before you proceed to contribute. Here are some procedures to help you overcome a complex repository and make your first step.

- [How Do I Understand a Complex Codebase At Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FErIfEd3IHI)

### Day 8: Common Software Architecture
Every project has its own standards on the project structure, development to deployment flow, and so on. But they have things in common. Get an overview so that you can understand different large projects quickly.

- [Development, test, performance, staging, canary, production… environments](https://walmyrlimaesilv.medium.com/development-test-performance-staging-canary-production-environments-a26c03509fa8)
- [Configuring issue templates for your repository - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)

### Day 9: How Big Open Source Project Works

On Day 9, we will delve into the topic of collaboration in large software projects. We will watch a video by Fireship that discusses a software development practice called 'Monorepos', and also read the official documentation of Next.js to understand how such large-scale projects operate.

- [Monorepos - How the Pros Scale Huge Software Projects // Turborepo vs Nx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iU_IE6vnJ8&ab_channel=Fireship)
- [How Next.js Works](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works)

### Day 10: Best Practices in Open Source Contribution
On Day 10, we will continue looking at some big open-source projects to understand how collaboration happens there. We will look into a popular area of open-source contribution this time: game development. Let’s learn what are the best practices preferred by Godot and Next.js.

- [Best practices for engine contributors — Godot Engine (latest) documentation in English](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/best_practices_for_engine_contributors.html)
- [Community: Contribution Guide | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/community/contribution-guide)

### Day 11: Setting up your environment
After understanding how collaboration in open-source projects works, it is time to go back to our IDE. On Day 11, we will learn how to set up and optimize your development environment to get ready for contributing by reading official documentation from Visual Studio and also a blog by FreeCodeCamp on NVM (Node version manager).

- [Working with JavaScript in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript#_intellisense)
- [Node Version Manager – NVM Install Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)

### Day 12: More on the Node package manager
Previously, we learned about the basics of setting up your development environment. Today on Day 12, we will further look into the Node package manager, including a more comprehensive guide on NPM and other alternatives, as well as a command cheatsheet to supercharge your productivity.

- [npm vs yarn vs pnpm vs bun commands cheatsheet - DEV Community](https://dev.to/equiman/npm-vs-yarn-vs-pnpm-commands-cheatsheet-3el8)

### Day 13: Testing in Open Source Projects
On Day 13, we will explore testing, an essential topic in contributing to open-source projects. We will read a guide on how to write unit tests with Jest and examine a real-world example repository to apply what we have learned.

- [A Beginner's Guide to Unit-testing with Jest - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dsasse07/a-beginner-s-guide-to-unit-testing-with-jest-45cc)

### Day 14: Writing maintainable codes (I)
So far, we have learned about different important topics in open source, from version control to environment setup. Today we will take a step by and learn more about how to write clean and maintainable code, which would be very valuable in open source collaboration.
